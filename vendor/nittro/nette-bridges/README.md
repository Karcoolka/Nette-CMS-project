Nittro Nette bridges
====================

This repository contains code that you may find useful when you're developing a Nette/Nittro app.

### v2.0 x v2.1-dev

The **2.1-dev** version has scalar type hints for compatibility with the v3 alphas of Nette - if you're
using a stable release of `nette/application` (i.e. `^2.4`), you should stick to `nittro/nette-bridges` `^2.0`,
whereas if you're on `nette/application` `^3.0`, you should go with `nittro/nette-bridges` `^2.1`.
